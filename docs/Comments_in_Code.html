<h1 id="top">Comments in Code</h1>
<p>All through this manual you will see examples of ViviFire code with comments.
Most of these comments start with an apostrophe (<code class="op">&#39;</code>) and stop at the end of the line.
You can also use two slashes (<code class="op">//</code>) as an alternative to an apostrophe.
The ViviFire compiler usually ignores all comments.</p>
<p>You put comments in your code to tell what other code does.
And frequently they give other information.</p>
<p>Comments can follow a statement on the same line, or fill a full line.
These are shown in the code that follows.</p>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>' This comment starts at the left edge of the screen.
Const Greeting = "Hello"  ' This comment is in-line.&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If a comment is too long for one line, use the comment symbol on each line.
An example follows:</p>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>' This comment is too long to keep it all on one line, thus it
' is necessary to break it into two.&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>A comment can follow a line-continuation sequence on the same line.
But you cannot use a line-continuation sequence to continue a comment, because comments ignore all such sequences.</p>
<p>Because the apostrophe can show almost the same as a quotation mark, some comments can cause warnings.
ViviFire shows a warning if an apostrophe follows one of these line-continuation sequences:
an assignment operator, a comma, a left parenthesis, or a left brace.
There are two possible corrections:
(1) put an underscore symbol (<code class="op">_</code>) before the apostrophe,
or (2) change the comment symbol to two slashes (<code class="op">//</code>).</p>
<p>The example that follows shows some conditions in which comments can cause warnings.</p>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>' This comment has no problem.
Function ConcatenatedFour(    ' This comment causes a warning.
      parameter1 As String,   // This comment has no problem.
      parameter2 As String,   ' This comment causes a warning.
      parameter3 As String, _ ' This comment has no problem.
      parameter4 As String) As String
    ConcatenatedFour = ' This comment causes a warning.
      parameter1 + parameter2 + parameter3 + parameter4
End Function&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<h2>Conventions for comments</h2>
<p>The list that follows gives some general instructions about what type of comment can come before a section of code.
These are only recommended procedures.
Do what you think is best for you and all the persons who will read your code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell what a procedure does, not how it does it.</li>
<li>Make a list of each external variable, control, file, or other element to which a procedure must have access.</li>
<li>Make a list of each external variable, control, or file that your code can change.
Tell what effect a change has, if it is not easily known.</li>
<li>Tell what each argument supplies to a procedure.</li>
<li>Tell what a procedure returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to write a comment before each important variable declaration that tells how you use it.</li>
<li>Try to give good names to variables, controls, and procedures.
Good names can make some comments shorter or not as necessary.</li>
<li>Write comments the same as sentences.
start with an upper-case letter, and put a period (or other applicable punctuation) at the end.</li>
</ul>
