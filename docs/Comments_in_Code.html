<h1 id="top">Comments in Code</h1>
<p>All through this manual you will see examples of ViviFire code with comments.
Most of these comments start with an apostrophe (<code class="op">&#39;</code>) and stop at the end of the line.
You can also use two slashes (<code class="op">//</code>) as an alternative.
The ViviFire compiler ignores all Comments.</p>
<p>You put comments in your code to tell what other code does.
And frequently they give other information.</p>
<p>There are two types of comments: the inline comment (given above) and the block comment.
A <dfn>block comment</dfn> has two symbols that identify the start and end of a comment.
Block comments can contain two or more lines.
Although you can put block comments between elements in one line, it can make code not as easy to read.</p>
<p>There are two types of block comment.
The first starts with <code class="op">/*</code> and stops after <code class="op">*/</code>.
The second starts with <code class="op">/&#39;</code> and stops after <code class="op">&#39;/</code>.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>' This is a full-line comment
PrintLine "Test" ' This comment is inline with code
PrintLine "Hi " &amp; name _  ' This comment
    &amp; " how are you?" ' is divided in two
/' This is a short block comment '/
/* This is a long block comment
    that is divided across more
    than one line.
*/
Call Test 1 /'one'/, 2 /'two'/, 3 /'three'/&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<h2>Recommended procedures for comments</h2>
<p>The list that follows gives some general instructions about what type of comment can come before a section of code.
These are only recommended procedures.
Do what you think is necessary for you and all persons who will read your code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell what a procedure does, not how it does it.</li>
<li>Make a list of each external variable, control, file, or other element to which a procedure must have access.</li>
<li>Make a list of each changed external variable, control, or file, and the effect that it has (only if it is not clear).</li>
<li>Tell what each argument gives to a procedure.</li>
<li>Tell what a procedure returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to write a comment before each important variable declaration that tells how you use it.</li>
<li>Try to give good names to variables, controls, and procedures.
Good names can make some comments shorter or not necessary.</li>
