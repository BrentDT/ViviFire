<h1 id="top">Comments in Code</h1>
<p>All through this manual you will see examples of ViviFire code with comments.
Most of these comments start with an apostrophe (<code class="op">&#39;</code>) and stop at the end of the line.
You can also use two slashes (<code class="op">//</code>) as an alternative.
The ViviFire compiler ignores all Comments.</p>
<p>You put comments in your code to tell what other code does.
And frequently they give other information.</p>
<p>There are two types of comments:
(1) the in-line comment, shown above, and (2) the mid-line comment.</p>
<p>A <dfn>mid-line comment</dfn> uses a pair of symbols to identify the start and end, and has one symbol between them.
The start is a slash-apostrophe (<code class="op">/'</code>) and the end is an apostrophe-slash (<code class="op">'/</code>).
The inner part can be a name, a number or date literal, or some sequence of characters that are a part of these symbols.</p>
<p>Permitted punctuation characters include <code>! # $ % - . / @ _</code>.
But, you cannot use other punctuation or whitespace characters.</p>
<p>You can write mid-line comments at several positions in a line of code.
But, you cannot write two adjacent comments on one line.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>// This is a full-line comment.
PrintLine "Test" ' This comment is in-line with code.
PrintLine "Hi " &amp; name _  ' This comment ...
    &amp; " how are you?" ' is divided in two.
Call Test 1 /'one'/, 2 /'two'/, 3 /'three'/&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<h2>Conventions for comments</h2>
<p>The list that follows gives some general instructions about what type of comment can come before a section of code.
These are only recommended procedures.
Do what you think is best for you and all the persons who will read your code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell what a procedure does, not how it does it.</li>
<li>Make a list of each external variable, control, file, or other element to which a procedure must have access.</li>
<li>Make a list of each external variable, control, or file that your code can change.
Tell what effect a change has, if it is not easily known.</li>
<li>Tell what each argument supplies to a procedure.</li>
<li>Tell what a procedure returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to write a comment before each important variable declaration that tells how you use it.</li>
<li>Try to give good names to variables, controls, and procedures.
Good names can make some comments shorter or not as necessary.</li>
<li>Write comments the same as sentences.
start with an upper-case letter, and put a period (or other applicable punctuation) at the end.</li>
