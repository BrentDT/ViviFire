<h1 id="top">Traits</h1>
<p>A <dfn>trait</dfn> is a construct that lets you use code again and again.
In a language that does not let classes inherit from more than one parent class, (which ViviFire is one), traits can decrease some of the limits this causes.
Traits let you use sets of methods freely in different classes, related or not.
The effects of the mixture of traits and classes are specified in a manner which is easy to accept.</p>
<p>A trait shows almost the same as a class, but specifies only behavior in a controlled manner.
You cannot make a variable from a trait.
Together with the usual inheritance construct, traits do what is known as <dfn>horizontal composition</dfn> of behavior.
That is, the trait applies its methods to a class without inheritance.</p>
<h2>Declaration of traits</h2>
<p>A trait usually starts with <code class="kw">Trait</code> and is completed with <code class="kw">End Trait</code>.
Between these two lines you can put one or more permitted statements:
<span class="kws"><code>Method</code>, <code>Property</code>, <code>Function</code>, <code>Sub</code>, and TBD</span>.</p>
<p>A class that uses a trait has access only to the public members of the trait&mdash;methods and properties.
These also become part of the interface of the class .
The class cannot directly get access to the other members of the trait.</p>
<p>A method or property is usually made with a body of statements.
But if you use the modifier <code class="at">@Abstract</code>, the method or property cannot have a body.
A class that uses the trait must declare the method or property again, and supply a body of statements.</p>
<h3>Multiple traits</h3>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3>When different methods have the same signature</h3>
<p>You have an example class that applies one or more traits.
If that class has two or more methods with the same signature, the result is a compiler error.
You can change the names of the methods to correct this error.</p>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>Trait A
    Method Calculate
        ' ...
    End Method
End Trait

Trait B
    Method Calculate
        ' ...
    End Method
End Trait

Class Calculator Does A Does B
    Method CalculateA Does A.Calculate
    Method CalculateB Does B.Calculate
End Class&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<h3>To Change method visibility</h3>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>Trait Foobar
    Method Foo
        ' ...
    End Method
    Method Bar
        ' ...
    End Method
End Trait

Class Barless Does Foobar
    Function Bar Does Foobar.Bar
End Class&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<h3>Traits composed from traits</h3>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>Trait Foo
    Method Foo
        ' ...
    End Method
End Trait

Trait Bar
    Method Bar
        ' ...
    End Method
End Trait

Trait Foobar Does Foo Does Bar
    ' ...
End Trait&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<h3>Abstract traits</h3>
<p>If all of the methods and properties of a trait must be abstract, you can put the modifier <code class="at">@Abstract</code> before the trait.
Then it is not necessary to put the modifier before each method and property.</p>
<p>An abstract trait has more limits than a usual trait:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must have one or more public procedures (<code class="kw">Method</code> or <code class="kw">Property</code>).</li>
<li>It must not have private procedures (<code class="kw">Function</code> and <code class="kw">Sub</code>).</li>
</ul>
