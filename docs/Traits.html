<h1 id="top">Traits</h1>
<p>ViviFire lets you use code again and again with a construct known as a <dfn>Trait</dfn>.
Traits are a possible alternative to multiple inheritance (a Class with many parents).
But they can also decrease some limits of single inheritance.</p>
<p>Traits let you use sets of methods again and again without limits in many classes independently.
And such classes do not have to be related through inheritance.</p>
<p>The semantics of traits and classes put together is made to be easy to use.
It also does not have the typical problems related to multiple inheritance and Mixins.</p>
<p>A trait looks almost the same as a class.
But its primary function is to make a group of operations that are usually small and fully related.</p>
<p>It is not possible to make instances of a trait directly.
Different from the usual inheritance, it lets you do horizontal composition of behavior.
In other words, it applies class members without inheritance.</p>
<h2>Declaration of traits</h2>
<p>A trait usually starts with <code class="kw">Trait</code> and is completed with <code class="kw">End Trait</code>.
Between these two lines you can put one or more permitted statements:
<span class="kws"><code>Method</code>, <code>Property</code>, <code>Function</code>, <code>Sub</code>, and TBD</span>.</p>
<p>A class that uses a trait has access only to the public members of the trait&mdash;methods and properties.
These also become part of the interface of the class .
The class cannot directly get access to the other members of the trait.</p>
<p>A method or property is usually made with a body of statements.
But if you use the modifier <code class="at">@Abstract</code>, the method or property cannot have a body.
A class that uses the trait must declare the method or property again, and supply a body of statements.</p>
<h3>Multiple traits</h3>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3>When different methods have the same signature</h3>
<p>You have an example class that applies one or more traits.
If that class has two or more methods with the same signature, the result is a compiler error.
You can change the names of the methods to correct this error.</p>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>Trait A
    Method Calculate
        ' ...
    End Method
End Trait

Trait B
    Method Calculate
        ' ...
    End Method
End Trait

Class Calculator Does A, B
    Method CalculateA Does A.Calculate
    Method CalculateB Does B.Calculate
End Class&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<h3>To Change method visibility</h3>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>Trait Foobar
    Method Foo
        ' ...
    End Method
    Method Bar
        ' ...
    End Method
End Trait

Class Barless Does Foobar
    Function Bar Does Foobar.Bar
End Class&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<h3>Traits composed from traits</h3>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>Trait Foo
    Method Foo
        ' ...
    End Method
End Trait

Trait Bar
    Method Bar
        ' ...
    End Method
End Trait

Trait Foobar Does Foo, Bar
    ' ...
End Trait&#10;</code></pre>
</div>
<h3>Abstract traits</h3>
<p>If all of the methods and properties of a trait must be abstract, you can put the modifier <code class="at">@Abstract</code> before the trait.
Then it is not necessary to put the modifier before each method and property.</p>
<p>An abstract trait has more limits than a usual trait:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must have one or more public procedures (<code class="kw">Method</code> or <code class="kw">Property</code>).</li>
<li>It must not have private procedures (<code class="kw">Function</code> and <code class="kw">Sub</code>).</li>
</ul>
