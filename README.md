# The ViviFire Programming Language

ViviFire is a brand new open-source programming language with modern features
and a familiar syntax.  It offers object-oriented programming with genericity
and traits, modularity, structured exception handling, and more.

Currently, ViviFire is at an alpha stage of development. The language is still
evolving, and may change dramatically before it's done.  If you are interested

ViviFire is released under the MIT license.
